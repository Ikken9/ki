A file-tree explorer for [ratatui](https://docs.rs/ratatui) based apps.

This started as a fork of [tui-rs-tree-widget](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/tui-rs-tree-widget) and evolved into a more feature-rich, functional file-tree explorer for specific use in [basalt](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt).

In the future, the functionalities may be extended and made more generic to enable plug-and-play integration with other projects.
